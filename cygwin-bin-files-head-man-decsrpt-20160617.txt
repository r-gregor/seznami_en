DESCRIPTION
       addftinfo  reads  a  troff font file and adds some additional font-metric information that is used by the groff system.  The font file with the information added is written on the standard
       output.  The information added is guessed using some parametric information about the font and assumptions about the traditional troff names for characters.  The main information added  is
       the  heights  and  depths  of  characters.  The res and unitwidth arguments should be the same as the corresponding parameters in the DESC file; font is the name of the file describing the
       font; if font ends with I the font will be assumed to be italic.

/bin/as
DESCRIPTION
       GNU as is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
       architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.

       as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld".  Nevertheless, we've tried to make as assemble correctly everything that other
       assemblers for the same machine would assemble.  Any exceptions are documented explicitly.  This doesn't mean as always uses the same syntax as another assembler for the same architecture;

/bin/ash
DESCRIPTION
     dash is the standard command interpreter for the system.  The current version of dash is in the process of being changed to conform with the POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the
     shell.  This version has many features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Korn shell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (see ksh(1)).  Only features designated by POSIX,
     plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this shell.  This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell.

       library features, and as a utility for managing dictionaries used by the library.

       The Aspell library contains an interface allowing other programs direct access to it's functions and therefore reducing the complex task of spell checking to  simple  library  calls.   The
       default  library does not contain dictionary word lists.  To add language dictionaries, please check your distro first for modified dictionaries, otherwise look here for base language dic-

       math library is available by command line option.  If requested, the math library is defined before processing any files.  bc starts by processing code from all the  files  listed  on  the
       command  line  in  the order listed.  After all files have been processed, bc reads from the standard input.  All code is executed as it is read.  (If a file contains a command to halt the
       processor, bc will never read from the standard input.)

       Bzcmp and bzdiff are used to invoke the cmp or the diff program on bzip2 compressed files.  All options specified are passed directly to cmp or diff.  If only 1 file is specified, then the
       files compared are file1 and an uncompressed file1.bz2.  If two files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp or diff.  The exit status from cmp  or  diff  is
       preserved.

/bin/bzip2
DESCRIPTION
       bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more con-
       ventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

       The command-line options are deliberately very similar to those of GNU gzip, but they are not identical.

/bin/bzless
DESCRIPTION
       Bzmore  is  a  filter  which  allows examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  bzmore works on files compressed with bzip2 and also on
       uncompressed files.  If a file does not exist, bzmore looks for a file of the same name with the addition of a .bz2 suffix.

       Bzmore normally pauses after each screenful, printing --More-- at the bottom of the screen.  If the user then types a carriage return, one more line is  displayed.   If  the  user  hits  a
       space, another screenful is displayed.  Other possibilities are enumerated later.

/bin/c++filt
DESCRIPTION
       The C++ and Java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types.
       In order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions C++ and Java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version.  This process
       is known as mangling. The c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names so that they can be read.

       Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores, dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential mangled name.  If the name decodes into a C++ name, the C++ name

       The following is the old c2ph.doc documentation by Tom Christiansen <tchrist@perl.com> Date: 25 Jul 91 08:10:21 GMT

       Once upon a time, I wrote a program called pstruct.  It was a perl program that tried to parse out C structures and display their member offsets for you.  This was especially useful for
       people looking at binary dumps or poking around the kernel.

/bin/c_rehash
DESCRIPTION
       c_rehash scans directories and calculates a hash value of each ".pem" file in the specified directory list and creates symbolic links for each file, where the name of the link is the hash
       value.  This utility is useful as many programs that use OpenSSL require directories to be set up like this in order to find certificates.

       If any directories are named on the command line, then those are processed in turn. If not, then the SSL_CERT_DIR environment variable is consulted; this shold be a colon-separated list of
       directories, like the Unix PATH variable.  If that is not set then the default directory (installation-specific but often /usr/local/ssl/certs) is processed.

/bin/cabextract
DESCRIPTION
       cabextract is a program that un-archives files in the Microsoft cabinet file format (.cab) or any binary file which contains an embedded cabinet file (frequently found in .exe files).

       cabextract will extract all files from all cabinet files specified on the command line.

       To  extract  a  multi-part  cabinet  consisting of several files, only the first cabinet file needs to be given as an argument to cabextract as it will automatically look for the remaining

DESCRIPTION
       captoinfo looks in each given text file for termcap descriptions.  For each one found, an equivalent terminfo description is written to standard output.  Termcap tc capabilities are trans-
       lated directly to terminfo use capabilities.

       If no file is given, then the environment variable TERMCAP is used for the filename or entry.  If TERMCAP is a full pathname to a file, only the terminal whose name  is  specified  in  the
       environment variable TERM is extracted from that file.  If the environment variable TERMCAP is not set, then the file /usr/share/terminfo is read.

/bin/catman
DESCRIPTION
       catman  is  used  to  create an up to date set of pre-formatted manual pages known as cat pages.  Cat pages are generally much faster to display than the original manual pages, but require
       extra storage space.  The decision to support cat pages is that of the local administrator, who must provide suitable directories to contain them.

       The options available to catman are the manual page hierarchies and sections to pre-format.  The default hierarchies are those specified as system hierarchies in the  man-db  configuration
       file,  and the default sections are either the colon-delimited contents of the environment variable $MANSECT or the standard set compiled into man if $MANSECT is undefined.  Supplying cat-

/bin/ccache
DESCRIPTION
       ccache is a compiler cache. It speeds up recompilation by caching the result of previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again. Supported languages are
       C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++.

       ccache has been carefully written to always produce exactly the same compiler output that you would get without the cache. The only way you should be able to tell that you are using ccache
       is the speed. Currently known exceptions to this goal are listed under BUGS. If you ever discover an undocumented case where ccache changes the output of your compiler, please let us know.

       This  manual  page  documents  the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to
       make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from  the  set  ugo.   Multiple  symbolic
       modes can be given, separated by commas.
#######################################
/bin/chown
DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of chown.  chown changes the user and/or group ownership of each given file.  If only an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that
       user is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group is not changed.  If the owner is followed by a colon and a group name (or numeric group ID), with no  spaces  between  them,
       the  group ownership of the files is changed as well.  If a colon but no group name follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the files and the group of the files is changed to
       that user's login group.  If the colon and group are given, but the owner is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this case, chown performs the same function as  chgrp.   If
       only a colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither the owner nor the group is changed.

/bin/code2html
DESCRIPTION
       code2html is a perl script which converts a program source code to syntax highlighted HTML, or any other format for wich rules are defined.


   (1) OPTIONS
       input-file
#######################################
/bin/col
DESCRIPTION
       col filters out reverse (and half-reverse) line feeds so the output is in the correct order, with only forward and half-forward line feeds.  It also replaces any whitespace characters with
       tabs where possible.  This can be useful in processing the output of nroff(1) and tbl(1).

       col reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

#######################################
/bin/colcrt
DESCRIPTION
       colcrt  provides  virtual  half-line  and reverse line feed sequences for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking is destructive.  Half-line characters and underlining
       (changed to dashing `-') are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.

OPTIONS
       -, --no-underlining
#######################################
/bin/colordiff
DESCRIPTION
       colordiff is a wrapper for diff and produces the same output as diff but with coloured syntax highlighting at the command line to improve readability. The output is similar to how a
       diff-generated patch might appear in Vim or Emacs with the appropriate syntax highlighting options enabled. The colour schemes can be read from a central configuration file or from a local
       user ~/.colordiffrc file.

       colordiff makes use of ANSI colours and as such will only work when ANSI colours can be used - typical examples are xterms and Eterms, as well as console sessions.
#######################################
/bin/colrm
DESCRIPTION
       colrm removes selected columns from a file.  Input is taken from standard input.  Output is sent to standard output.

       If called with one parameter the columns of each line will be removed starting with the specified first column.  If called with two parameters the columns from the first column to the last
       column will be removed.

#######################################
/bin/column
DESCRIPTION
       The  column  utility  formats  its  input  into multiple columns.  By default, rows are filled before columns.  Input is taken from file, or otherwise from standard input.  Empty lines are
       ignored.

OPTIONS
       -c, --columns width
#######################################
/bin/combinediff
DESCRIPTION
       combinediff creates a unified diff that expresses the sum of two diffs. The diff files must be listed in the order that they are to be applied. For best results, the diffs must have at
       least three lines of context.

       Since combinediff doesn't have the advantage of being able to look at the files that are to be modified, it has stricter requirements on the input format than patch(1) does. The output of
       GNU diff will be okay, even with extensions, but if you intend to use a hand-edited patch it might be wise to clean up the offsets and counts using recountdiff(1) first.
#######################################
/bin/comm
DESCRIPTION
       Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.

       With no options, produce three-column output.  Column one contains lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files.

/bin/config_data
DESCRIPTION
       The "config_data" tool provides a command-line interface to the configuration of Perl modules.  By "configuration", we mean something akin to "user preferences" or "local settings".  This
       is a formalization and abstraction of the systems that people like Andreas Koenig ("CPAN::Config"), Jon Swartz ("HTML::Mason::Config"), Andy Wardley ("Template::Config"), and Larry Wall
       (perl's own Config.pm) have developed independently.

       The configuration system emplyed here was developed in the context of "Module::Build".  Under this system, configuration information for a module "Foo", for example, is stored in a module

/bin/cpp
DESCRIPTION
       The C preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before compilation.  It is called a macro processor
       because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.

       The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general text processor.  It will choke on input which does
       not obey C's lexical rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it preserving characteristics

/bin/ctags
DESCRIPTION
       The  ctags  and  etags  programs  (hereinafter  collectively  referred to as ctags, except where distinguished) generate an index (or "tag") file for a variety of language objects found in
       file(s).  This tag file allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility. A "tag" signifies a language object for which an  index  entry  is  available
       (or, alternatively, the index entry created for that object).

       Alternatively, ctags can generate a cross reference file which lists, in human readable form, information about the various source objects found in a set of language files.

        The  cygcheck program is a diagnostic utility for dealing with Cygwin programs. If you are familiar with dpkg or  rpm, cygcheck is similar in many ways.  (The  major  difference  is  that

        The   -c  option  checks the version and status of  installed Cygwin packages. If you specify one or more package names, cygcheck will limit its output to those packages, or with no argu-
       ments it lists all packages. A package will be marked Incomplete if files originally installed are no longer present. The best thing to do in that situation is reinstall the  package  with

/bin/dc
DESCRIPTION
       dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports unlimited precision arithmetic.  It also allows you to define and call macros.  Normally dc reads from the standard input; if any com-
       mand arguments are given to it, they are filenames, and dc reads and executes the contents of the files before reading from standard input.  All normal output is to  standard  output;  all
       error output is to standard error.

       A reverse-polish calculator stores numbers on a stack.  Entering a number pushes it on the stack.  Arithmetic operations pop arguments off the stack and push the results.

/bin/diffstat
DESCRIPTION
       This  program reads the output of diff and displays a histogram of the insertions, deletions, and modifications per-file.  Diffstat is a program that is useful for reviewing large, complex
       patch files.  It reads from one or more input files which contain output from diff, producing a histogram of the total lines changed for each file referenced.

       If the input filename ends with .bz2, .gz, .lzma, .z or .Z, diffstat will read the uncompressed data via a pipe from the corresponding program.  It also can infer the compression type from
       files piped via the standard input.

#######################################
/bin/dirsplit
DESCRIPTION
       displit  is  designed  to for a simple purpose: convert a directory with many multiple files (which are all smaller than a certain medium, eg.  DVD) and "splits" it into "volumes", looking
       for the optimal order to get the best space/medium-number efficiency.

       The actual action is either adding the files to mkisofs catalogs or real moving of files into new directories (or creating links/symlinks).  The method  is  not  limited  to  files,  whole
       directories can also be handled this way (see various filesystem exploration modes).

#######################################
/bin/dlltool
DESCRIPTION
       dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line.  It then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been
       specified it creates a exports file.  If the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file.  Any or all of the -e, -l
       and -z options can be present in one invocation of dlltool.

       When creating a DLL, along with the source for the DLL, it is necessary to have three other files.  dlltool can help with the creation of these files.

       The dprofpp command interprets profile data produced by a profiler, such as the Devel::DProf profiler.  Dprofpp will read the file tmon.out and display the 15 subroutines which are using
       the most time.  By default the times for each subroutine are given exclusive of the times of their child subroutines.

       To profile a Perl script run the perl interpreter with the -d switch.  So to profile script test.pl with Devel::DProf use the following:

/bin/duff
DESCRIPTION
     The duff utility reports clusters of duplicates in the specified files and/or directories.  In the default mode, duff prints a customizable header, followed by the names of all the files in
     the cluster.  In excess mode, duff does not print a header, but instead for each cluster prints the names of all but the first of the files it includes.

     If no files are specified as arguments, duff reads file names from stdin.

/bin/email
DESCRIPTION
       Email  is  a  command  line  email  client similiar to 'mailx'.  Added features make this a more advanced client for sending email via the command line.  Email works with sendmail, just as
       'mailx' does, but email also allows sending to remote smtp servers for your email delivery.  It also works with GPG for encrypting and signing the emails on the fly.

       Email also incorporates a few other features as well.  These features include signature files with wildcard options to specify the data, time, day, version, system, and  even  a  'fortune'
       with  the  help  of  the  'fortune' command.  Email also supports a very configurable address book.  This way you can specify a persons name with an email address and also place a group of

/bin/enc2xs
DESCRIPTION
       enc2xs builds a Perl extension for use by Encode from either Unicode Character Mapping files (.ucm) or Tcl Encoding Files (.enc).  Besides being used internally during the build process of
       the Encode module, you can use enc2xs to add your own encoding to perl.  No knowledge of XS is necessary.

Quick Guide
       If you want to know as little about Perl as possible but need to add a new encoding, just read this chapter and forget the rest.

/bin/eps2eps
DESCRIPTION
       ps2ps  uses gs(1) to convert PostScript(tm) file "input.ps" to simpler, normalized and (usually) faster PostScript in "output.ps".  Normally the output is allowed to use PostScript Level 2
       or Level 3 constructs, but the -dLanguageLevel=1 option restricts the output to Level 1.

       eps2eps performs the equivalent optimization for Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files.

/bin/eqn
DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes  the GNU version of eqn, which is part of the groff document formatting system.  eqn compiles descriptions of equations embedded within troff input files into
       commands that are understood by troff.  Normally, it should be invoked using the -e option of groff.  The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn.  The output of GNU eqn  cannot  be  pro-
       cessed with Unix troff; it must be processed with GNU troff.  If no files are given on the command line, the standard input is read.  A filename of - causes the standard input to be read.

       eqn searches for the file eqnrc in the directories given with the -M option first, then in /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac, /usr/share/groff/site-tmac, and finally in the standard macro directory
#######################################
/bin/eqn2graph
DESCRIPTION
       Reads an EQN equation (one line) as input; produces an image file (by default in Portable Network Graphics format) suitable for the Web as output.

       Your input EQN code should not have the .EQ/.EN preamble that that normally precedes it within groff(1) macros; nor do you need to have dollar-sign or other delimiters around the equation.

       The  output  image will be clipped to the smallest possible bounding box that contains all the black pixels.  Older versions of convert(1) will produce a black-on-white graphic; newer ones

/bin/espdiff
DESCRIPTION
       espdiff applies the appropriate transformation to a patch or set of patches, depending on what you intend to accomplish.

       The input patches must be "clean": in other words they must apply without fuzz or offsets in whichever order they are meant to be applied. The exception is if you intend espdiff to clean
       them for you (good luck).

#######################################
/bin/etags
DESCRIPTION
       The  ctags  and  etags  programs  (hereinafter  collectively  referred to as ctags, except where distinguished) generate an index (or "tag") file for a variety of language objects found in
       file(s).  This tag file allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility. A "tag" signifies a language object for which an  index  entry  is  available
       (or, alternatively, the index entry created for that object).

       Alternatively, ctags can generate a cross reference file which lists, in human readable form, information about the various source objects found in a set of language files.

/bin/fax2ps
DESCRIPTION
       fax2ps reads one or more TIFF facsimile image files and prints a compressed form of PostScript on the standard output that is suitable for printing.

       By  default, each page is scaled to reflect the image dimensions and resolutions stored in the file.  The -x and -y options can be used to specify the horizontal and vertical image resolu-
       tions (lines/inch), respectively.  If the -S option is specified, each page is scaled to fill an output page.  The default output page is 8.5 by 11 inches.  Alternate page  dimensions  can
       be specified in inches with the -W and -H options.
#######################################
/bin/fax2tiff
DESCRIPTION
       Fax2tiff  creates a TIFF file containing CCITT Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data from one or more files containing ``raw'' Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data (typically obtained directly from a
       fax modem).  By default, each row of data in the resultant TIFF file is 1-dimensionally encoded and padded or truncated to 1728 pixels, as needed.  The resultant image is a set of low res-
       olution (98 lines/inch) or medium resolution (196 lines/inch) pages, each of which is a single strip of data.  The generated file conforms to the TIFF Class F (FAX) specification for stor-
       ing facsimile data.  This means, in particular, that each page of the data does not include the trailing return to control (RTC) code; as required for transmission by  the  CCITT  Group  3
       specifications.  The old, ``classic'', format is created if the -c option is used.  (The Class F format can also be requested with the -f option.)
#######################################
/bin/fc-cache
DESCRIPTION
       fc-cache scans the font directories on the system and builds font information cache files for applications using fontconfig for their font handling.

       If  directory  arguments  are  not  given, fc-cache uses each directory in the current font configuration. Each directory is scanned for font files readable by FreeType. A cache is created
       which contains properties of each font and the associated filename.  This cache is used to speed up application startup when using the fontconfig library.

#######################################
/bin/fc-cat
DESCRIPTION
       fc-cat reads the font information from cache files or related to font directories and emits it in ASCII form.

#######################################
/bin/fc-match
DESCRIPTION
       fc-match  matches  pattern (empty pattern by default) using the normal fontconfig matching rules to find the best font available. If --sort is given, the sorted list of best matching fonts
       is displayed.  The --all option works like --sort except that no pruning is done on the list of fonts.

       If any elements are specified, only those are printed.  Otherwise short file name, family, and style are printed, unless verbose output is requested.

#######################################
/bin/fc-pattern
DESCRIPTION
       fc-pattern  parses  pattern  (empty  pattern  by  default)  and  shows the parsed result.  If --config is given, config substitution is performed on the pattern before being displayed.  If
       --default is given, default substitution is performed on the pattern before being displayed.

       If any elements are specified, only those are printed.

#######################################
/bin/fc-query
DESCRIPTION
       fc-query  queries font-file(s) using the normal fontconfig rules and prints out font pattern for each face found.  If --index is given, only one face of each file is queried, otherwise all
       faces are queried.

/bin/figlet
DESCRIPTION
       FIGlet  prints  its input using large characters (called ``FIGcharacters'')made up of ordinary screen characters (called ``sub-characters'').  FIGlet output is generally reminiscent of the
       sort of ``signatures'' many people like to put at the end of e-mail and UseNet messages.  It is also reminiscent of the output of some banner programs, although it  is  oriented  normally,
       not sideways.

       FIGlet can print in a variety of fonts, both left-to-right and right-to-left, with adjacent FIGcharacters kerned and ``smushed'' together in various ways.  FIGlet fonts are stored in sepa-

/bin/flipdiff
DESCRIPTION
       flipdiff exchanges the order of two patch files that apply one after the other. The patches must be "clean": the context lines must match and there should be no mis-matched offsets.

       The swapped patches are sent to standard output, with a marker line ("=== 8< === cut here === 8< ===") between them, unless the --in-place option is passed. In that case, the output is
       written back to the original input files.

/bin/flock
DESCRIPTION
       This utility manages flock(2) locks from within shell scripts or from the command line.

       The  first and second of the above forms wrap the lock around the execution of a command, in a manner similar to su(1) or newgrp(1).  They lock a specified file or directory, which is cre-
       ated (assuming appropriate permissions) if it does not already exist.  By default, if the lock cannot be immediately acquired, flock waits until the lock is available.

/bin/funzip
              Optional password to be used if ZIP archive is encrypted.  Decryption may not be supported at some sites.  See DESCRIPTION for more details.

       [input[.zip|.gz]]
              Optional input archive file specification. See DESCRIPTION for details.

DESCRIPTION
       funzip  without a file argument acts as a filter; that is, it assumes that a ZIP archive (or a gzip'd(1) file) is being piped into standard input, and it extracts the first member from the
       archive to stdout.  When stdin comes from a tty device, funzip assumes that this cannot be a stream of (binary) compressed data and shows a short help text, instead.  If there  is  a  file
       argument, then input is read from the specified file instead of from stdin.

       A password for encrypted zip files can be specified on the command line (preceding the file name, if any) by prefixing the password with a dash.  Note that this constitutes a security risk
#######################################
/bin/g++
DESCRIPTION
       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the -c
       option says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.

       Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of
       these are not documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

/bin/gawk
DESCRIPTION
       Gawk is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming language.  It conforms to the definition of the language in the POSIX 1003.1 Standard.  This version in turn is based on the
       description in The AWK Programming Language, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger.  Gawk provides the additional features found in the current version of Brian Kernighan's awk and a number of
       GNU-specific extensions.

       The  command  line consists of options to gawk itself, the AWK program text (if not supplied via the -f or --file options), and values to be made available in the ARGC and ARGV pre-defined

/bin/gccmakedep
DESCRIPTION
       The gccmakedep program calls 'gcc -M' to output makefile rules describing the dependencies of each sourcefile, so that make(1) knows which object files must be recompiled when a dependency
       has changed.

       By default, gccmakedep places its output in the file named makefile if it exists, otherwise Makefile.  An alternate makefile may be specified with the -f option.   It  first  searches  the
       makefile for a line beginning with

/bin/gcov
DESCRIPTION
       gcov is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with GCC to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program.
       You can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to
       assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time.

       Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a profiler such as gcov or gprof, you can find out some basic performance statistics, such as:

/bin/gdbserver
DESCRIPTION
       gdbserver is a program that allows you to run GDB on a different machine than the one which is running the program being debugged.

       Usage (server (target) side):

       First, you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug put onto the target system.  The program can be stripped to save space if needed, as gdbserver doesn't care about symbols.

#######################################
/bin/getopt
DESCRIPTION
       getopt is used to break up (parse) options in command lines for easy parsing by shell procedures, and to check for legal options.  It uses the GNU getopt(3) routines to do this.

       The parameters getopt is called with can be divided into two parts: options which modify the way getopt will do the parsing (the options and the optstring in the SYNOPSIS), and the parame-
       ters which are to be parsed (parameters in the SYNOPSIS).  The second part will start at the first non-option parameter that is not an option argument, or after  the  first  occurrence  of
       '--'.  If no '-o' or '--options' option is found in the first part, the first parameter of the second part is used as the short options string.
#######################################
/bin/gfortran
DESCRIPTION
       The gfortran command supports all the options supported by the gcc command.  Only options specific to GNU Fortran are documented here.

       All GCC and GNU Fortran options are accepted both by gfortran and by gcc (as well as any other drivers built at the same time, such as g++), since adding GNU Fortran to the GCC
       distribution enables acceptance of GNU Fortran options by all of the relevant drivers.

/bin/gpg
DESCRIPTION
       gpg  is  the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP standard. gpg features complete key management
       and all bells and whistles you can expect from a decent OpenPGP implementation.

       This is the standalone version of gpg.  For desktop use you should consider using gpg2  ([On some platforms gpg2 is installed under the name gpg]).

#######################################
/bin/gpgsplit
#######################################
/bin/gpgv
DESCRIPTION
       gpgv is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

       This  program  is  actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg and uses a different (and simpler) way to
       check that the public keys used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration files and only a few options are implemented.

#######################################
/bin/gprof
DESCRIPTION
       "gprof" produces an execution profile of C, Pascal, or Fortran77 programs.  The effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller.  The profile data is taken from the
       call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77".  The -pg option also links in versions of the
       library routines that are compiled for profiling.  "Gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out") and establishes the relation between its symbol table and the call graph
       profile from gmon.out.  If more than one profile file is specified, the "gprof" output shows the sum of the profile information in the given profile files.

#######################################
/bin/grap2graph
DESCRIPTION
       Reads a grap program as input; produces an image file (by default in Portable Network Graphics format) suitable for the Web as output.  For a description of the grap language, see grap(1).

       Your graph specification should not be wrapped with the .G1 and .G2 macros that normally guard it within groff(1) macros.

       The output image will be a black-on-white graphic clipped to the smallest possible bounding box that contains all the black pixels.  By specifying command-line options to be passed to con-

/bin/grep
DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches  the named input FILEs for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  If no files are specified, or if the file "-" is given, grep searches standard input.  By default,
       grep prints the matching lines.

       In addition, the variant programs egrep and fgrep are the same as grep -E and grep -F, respectively.  These variants are deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.

#######################################
/bin/grepdiff
DESCRIPTION
       For each file modified by a patch, if the patch hunk contains the REGEX then the file's name is printed.

       The regular expression is treated as POSIX Basic Regular Expression syntax, unless the -E option is given in which case POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax is used.

       For example, to see the patches in my.patch which contain the regular expression "pf_gfp_mask", use:
#######################################
/bin/grn
DESCRIPTION
       grn  is a preprocessor for including gremlin pictures in groff input.  grn writes to standard output, processing only input lines between two that start with .GS and .GE.  Those lines must
       contain grn commands (see below).  These commands request a gremlin file, and the picture in that file is converted and placed in the troff input stream.  The .GS request may  be  followed
       by a C, L, or R to center, left, or right justify the whole gremlin picture (default justification is center).  If no file is mentioned, the standard input is read.  At the end of the pic-
       ture, the position on the page is the bottom of the gremlin picture.  If the grn entry is ended with .GF instead of .GE, the position is left at the top of the picture.

#######################################
/bin/grodvi
DESCRIPTION
       grodvi  is  a  driver  for  groff  that  produces  TeX  dvi  format.   Normally  it  should  be  run  by  groff -Tdvi.   This  will  run  troff -Tdvi;  it  will  also  input  the macros in
       /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac/dvi.tmac.

       The dvi file generated by grodvi can be printed by any correctly-written dvi driver.  The troff drawing primitives are implemented using the tpic version 2 specials.  If  the  driver  does
       not support these, the \D commands will not produce any output.
#######################################
/bin/groff
DESCRIPTION
       This document describes the groff program, the main front-end for the groff document formatting system.  The groff program and macro suite is the implementation of a roff(7) system  within
       the free software collection GNU <http://www.gnu.org>.  The groff system has all features of the classical roff, but adds many extensions.

       The groff program allows to control the whole groff system by command line options.  This is a great simplification in comparison to the classical case (which uses pipes only).

#######################################
/bin/groffer
DESCRIPTION
       The groffer program is the easiest way to use groff(1).  It can display arbitrary documents written in the groff language, see groff(7), or other roff languages, see roff(7), that are com-
       patible to the original troff language.  It finds and runs all necessary groff preprocessors, such as chem.

       The groffer program also includes many of the features for finding and displaying the Unix manual pages (man pages), such that it can be used as a replacement for a man(1) program.   More-
       over, compressed files that can be handled by gzip(1) or bzip2(1) are decompressed on-the-fly.
#######################################
/bin/grog
DESCRIPTION
       grog  reads  the  input (file names or standard input) and guesses which of the groff(1) options are needed to perform the input with the groff program.  The corresponding groff command is
       output.

OPTIONS
       The only grog options recognized are -C (which is also passed on) to enable compatibility mode; -v and --version print information on the version number; and  -h  and  --help  print  usage

#######################################
/bin/gropdf
DESCRIPTION
       gropdf  translates  the  output  of  GNU  troff to PDF.  Normally gropdf should be invoked by using the groff command with a -Tpdf option.  If no files are given, gropdf reads the standard
       input.  A filename of - also causes gropdf to read the standard input.  PDF output is written to the standard output.  When gropdf is run by groff options can be  passed  to  gropdf  using
       groff's -P option.

       See section FONT INSTALLATION below for a guide how to install fonts for gropdf.
#######################################
/bin/grops
DESCRIPTION
       grops  translates the output of GNU troff to PostScript.  Normally grops should be invoked by using the groff command with a -Tps option.  (Actually, this is the default for groff.)  If no
       files are given, grops reads the standard input.  A filename of - also causes grops to read the standard input.  PostScript output is written to the standard output.  When grops is run  by
       groff options can be passed to grops using groff's -P option.

       Note that grops doesn't produce a valid document structure (conforming to the Document Structuring Convention) if called with multiple file arguments.  To print such concatenated output it

/bin/grotty
DESCRIPTION
       grotty translates the output of GNU troff into a form suitable for typewriter-like devices.  Normally grotty should be invoked by using the groff command with a -Tascii, -Tlatin1 or -Tutf8
       option on ASCII based systems, and with -Tcp1047 and -Tutf8 on EBCDIC based hosts.  If no files are given, grotty reads the standard input.  A filename of - also causes grotty to read  the
       standard input.  Output is written to the standard output.

       By  default,  grotty emits SGR escape sequences (from ISO 6429, also called ANSI color escapes) to change text attributes (bold, italic, colors).  This makes it possible to have eight dif-

       and executes them as Ghostscript programs. After doing this, it reads further input from the standard input stream (normally the keyboard), interpreting each line separately and output  to
       an  output  device  (may  be a file or an X11 window preview, see below). The interpreter exits gracefully when it encounters the "quit" command (either in a file or from the keyboard), at
       end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such as Control-C at the keyboard).

       The JPEG-2000 specification specifies two different formats: JP2 and JPEG-2000 code stream (JPC).  JP2 represents a visual image quite specifically, whereas JPC is a more or less arbitrary

/bin/jpegtopnm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       jpegtopnm converts JFIF images to PPM or PGM images.

       By default, jpegtopnm expects the input stream to contain one JFIF image and produces one PGM or PPM image as output.  It fails if the input stream is empty.
#######################################
/bin/jpegtran
DESCRIPTION
       jpegtran  performs  various useful transformations of JPEG files.  It can translate the coded representation from one variant of JPEG to another, for example from baseline JPEG to progres-
       sive JPEG or vice versa.  It can also perform some rearrangements of the image data, for example turning an image from landscape to portrait format by rotation.

       jpegtran works by rearranging the compressed data (DCT coefficients), without ever fully decoding the image.  Therefore, its transformations are lossless: there is no image degradation  at
       all,  which  would  not be true if you used djpeg followed by cjpeg to accomplish the same conversion.  But by the same token, jpegtran cannot perform lossy operations such as changing the

/bin/json_pp
DESCRIPTION
       json_pp converts between some input and output formats (one of them is JSON).  This program was copied from json_xs and modified.

       The default input format is json and the default output format is json with pretty option.

/bin/kill
DESCRIPTION
       The   kill program allows you to send arbitrary signals to other Cygwin programs.  The usual purpose is to end a running program from some other window when ^C won't work, but you can also
       send program-specified signals such as SIGUSR1 to trigger actions within the program, like enabling debugging or re-opening log files. Each program defines the signals they understand.

       You may need to specify the full path to use  kill  from within some shells, including  bash, the default Cygwin shell. This is because  bash defines a   kill  builtin  function;  see  the
       bash man page under  BUILTIN COMMANDS for more information. To make sure you are using the Cygwin version, try

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The  LaTeX  language  is  described  in the book LaTeX - A Document Preparation System.  LaTeX is a TeX macro package, not a modification to the TeX source program, so all the capabilities
       described in tex(1) are present.

/bin/ld
DESCRIPTION
       ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld.

       ld accepts Linker Command Language files written in a superset of AT&T's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.

       This man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and on other aspects of the GNU linker.

       Interleaf is a now-defunct (actually purchased ca. 2000 by BroadVision) technical publishing software company.
#######################################
/bin/less
DESCRIPTION
       Less  is a program similar to more (1), but which allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting,
       so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even  lim-
       ited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)

       Commands are based on both more and vi.  Commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  The number is used by some commands, as indicated.
#######################################
/bin/lessecho
DESCRIPTION
       lessecho is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard output.  But any metacharacter in the output is preceded by an "escape" character, which by default is a backslash.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

#######################################
/bin/lesskey
DESCRIPTION
       Lesskey is used to specify a set of key bindings to be used by less.  The input file is a text file which describes the key bindings.  If the input file is "-", standard input is read.  If
       no input file is specified, a standard filename is used as the name of the input file, which depends on the system being used: On Unix systems, $HOME/.lesskey is used; on  MS-DOS  systems,
       $HOME/_lesskey  is  used;  and on OS/2 systems $HOME/lesskey.ini is used, or $INIT/lesskey.ini if $HOME is undefined.  The output file is a binary file which is used by less.  If no output
       file is specified, and the environment variable LESSKEY is set, the value of LESSKEY is used as the name of the output file.  Otherwise, a standard filename is used as the name of the out-
       put  file,  which  depends  on the system being used: On Unix and OS-9 systems, $HOME/.less is used; on MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_less is used; and on OS/2 systems, $HOME/less.ini is used, or

/bin/lexgrog
DESCRIPTION
       lexgrog  is  an implementation of the traditional "groff guess" utility in lex.  It reads the list of files on its command line as either man page source files or preformatted "cat" pages,
       and displays their name and description as used by apropos and whatis, the list of preprocessing filters required by the man page before it is passed to nroff or troff, or both.

       If its input is badly formatted, lexgrog will print "parse failed"; this may be useful for external programs that need to check man pages for correctness.  If one of lexgrog's input  files
       is "-", it will read from standard input; if any input file is compressed, a decompressed version will be read automatically.
#######################################
/bin/lftp
DESCRIPTION
       lftp  is  a  file transfer program that allows sophisticated FTP, HTTP and other connections to other hosts. If site is specified then lftp will connect to that site otherwise a connection
       has to be established with the open command.

       lftp can handle several file access methods - FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, HFTP, FISH, SFTP and file (HTTPS and FTPS are only available when lftp is compiled with GNU TLS or  OpenSSL  library).
       You  can  specify the method to use in `open URL' command, e.g. `open http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux'. HFTP is ftp-over-http-proxy protocol. It can be used automatically instead of FTP

DESCRIPTION
       lkbib  searches  bibliographic  databases  for  references that contain the keys key... and prints any references found on the standard output.  lkbib will search any databases given by -p
       options, and then a default database.  The default database is taken from the REFER environment variable if it is set, otherwise it is /usr/dict/papers/Ind.  For each database filename  to
       be searched, if an index filename.i created by indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead; each index can cover multiple databases.

/bin/ln
DESCRIPTION
       In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.  In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET
       in DIRECTORY.  Create hard links by default, symbolic links with --symbolic.  By default, each destination (name of new link) should not already exist.  When creating hard links, each TAR-
       GET must exist.  Symbolic links can hold arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link is interpreted in relation to its parent directory.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
#######################################
/bin/lndir
DESCRIPTION
       The  lndir program makes a shadow copy todir of a directory tree fromdir, except that the shadow is not populated with real files but instead with symbolic links pointing at the real files
       in the fromdir directory tree.  This is usually useful for maintaining source code for different machine architectures.  You create a shadow directory containing links to the real  source,
       which  you  will  have  usually mounted from a remote machine.  You can build in the shadow tree, and the object files will be in the shadow directory, while the source files in the shadow
       directory are just symlinks to the real files.

#######################################
/bin/locale
DESCRIPTION
        locale without parameters prints information about the current locale environment settings.

       The   -u option prints the current user's Windows default locale to stdout.  The  -s option prints the systems default locale instead.  With the  -U option locale appends a ".UTF-8".  This
       can be used in scripts to set the Cygwin locale to the Windows user or system default, for instance:

#######################################
/bin/locate
DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of locate.  For each given pattern, locate searches one or more databases of file names and displays the file names  that  contain  the  pattern.
       Patterns can contain shell-style metacharacters: `*', `?', and `[]'.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.'  specially.  Therefore, a pattern `foo*bar' can match a file name that con-
       tains `foo3/bar', and a pattern `*duck*' can match a file name that contains `lake/.ducky'.  Patterns that contain metacharacters should be quoted to protect them  from  expansion  by  the
       shell.

#######################################
/bin/logger
DESCRIPTION
       logger makes entries in the system log.  It provides a shell command interface to the syslog(3) system log module.

OPTIONS
       -d, --udp

/bin/look
DESCRIPTION
       The  look utility displays any lines in file which contain string.  As look performs a binary search, the lines in file must be sorted (where sort(1) got the same options -d and/or -f that
       look is invoked with).

       If file is not specified, the file /usr/share/dict/words is used, only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic characters is ignored.

#######################################
/bin/lookbib
DESCRIPTION
       lookbib  prints  a prompt on the standard error (unless the standard input is not a terminal), reads from the standard input a line containing a set of keywords, searches the bibliographic
       databases filename... for references containing those keywords, prints any references found on the standard output, and repeats this process until the end  of  input.   For  each  database
       filename to be searched, if an index filename.i created by indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead; each index can cover multiple databases.

       LyX is a document preparation system. It excels at letting you create complex technical and scientific articles with mathematics, cross-references, bibliographies, indices, etc. It is very
       good at documents of any length in which the usual processing abilities are required: automatic sectioning and pagination, spellchecking, and so forth. It can also be used to write a  let-
       ter  to  your  mom,  though granted, there are probably simpler programs available for that. It is definitely not the best tool for creating banners, flyers, or advertisements, though with

       xz  is a general-purpose data compression tool with command line syntax similar to gzip(1) and bzip2(1).  The native file format is the .xz format, but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA
       Utils and raw compressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.

       xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected operation mode.  If no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard input and writes the processed data  to  stan-
       dard  output.   xz will refuse (display an error and skip the file) to write compressed data to standard output if it is a terminal.  Similarly, xz will refuse to read compressed data from

DESCRIPTION
       xzcmp  and xzdiff invoke cmp(1) or diff(1) on files compressed with xz(1), lzma(1), gzip(1), or bzip2(1).  All options specified are passed directly to cmp(1) or diff(1).  If only one file
       is specified, then the files compared are file1 (which must have a suffix of a supported compression format) and file1 from which the compression format suffix has been stripped.   If  two
       files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp(1) or diff(1).  The exit status from cmp(1) or diff(1) is preserved.

       The names lzcmp and lzdiff are provided for backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.

DESCRIPTION
       xzless is a filter that displays text from compressed files to a terminal.  It works on files compressed with xz(1) or lzma(1).  If no files are given, xzless reads from standard input.

       xzless uses less(1) to present its output.  Unlike xzmore, its choice of pager cannot be altered by setting an environment variable.  Commands are based on both more(1) and vi(1) and allow
       back and forth movement and searching.  See the less(1) manual for more information.

/bin/lzmadec
DESCRIPTION
       xzdec  is  a  liblzma-based decompression-only tool for .xz (and only .xz) files.  xzdec is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for xz(1) in the most common situations where a script
       has been written to use xz --decompress --stdout (and possibly a few other commonly used options) to decompress .xz files.  lzmadec is identical to xzdec except that lzmadec supports .lzma
       files instead of .xz files.

       To  reduce the size of the executable, xzdec doesn't support multithreading or localization, and doesn't read options from XZ_DEFAULTS and XZ_OPT environment variables.  xzdec doesn't sup-

/bin/lzmainfo
DESCRIPTION
       lzmainfo  shows  information  stored  in the .lzma file header.  It reads the first 13 bytes from the specified file, decodes the header, and prints it to standard output in human readable
       format.  If no files are given or file is -, standard input is read.

       Usually the most interesting information is the uncompressed size and the dictionary size.  Uncompressed size can be shown only if the file is in the  non-streamed  .lzma  format  variant.
       The amount of memory required to decompress the file is a few dozen kilobytes plus the dictionary size.
#######################################
/bin/lzmore
DESCRIPTION
       xzmore is a filter which allows examination of xz(1) or lzma(1) compressed text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.

       To use a pager other than the default more, set environment variable PAGER to the name of the desired program.  The name lzmore is provided for backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.

       e or q When the prompt --More--(Next file: file) is printed, this command causes xzmore to exit.

/bin/mac2unix
DESCRIPTION
       The Dos2unix package includes utilities "dos2unix" and "unix2dos" to convert plain text files in DOS or Mac format to Unix format and vice versa.

       In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination of two characters: a Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix text files a line break is a
       single character: the Line Feed (LF). In Mac text files, prior to Mac OS X, a line break was single Carriage Return (CR) character. Nowadays Mac OS uses Unix style (LF) line breaks.

/bin/mad
DESCRIPTION
       Mmv  moves  (or copies, appends, or links, as specified) each source file matching a from pattern to the target name specified by the to pattern.  This multiple action is performed safely,
       i.e. without any unexpected deletion of files due to collisions of target names with existing filenames or with other target names.  Furthermore, before doing  anything,  mmv  attempts  to
       detect  any errors that would result from the entire set of actions specified and gives the user the choice of either proceeding by avoiding the offending parts or aborting.  mmv does sup-
       port large files (LFS) but it does *NOT* support sparse files (i.e. it explodes them).

/bin/make
DESCRIPTION
       The  make utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation
       of make, which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are very common,  but  you  can  use
       make  with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command.  In fact, make is not limited to programs.  You can use it to describe any task where some files must be
       updated automatically from others whenever the others change.

/bin/man
DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with each of these arguments  is  then
       found  and displayed. A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-
       defined order ("1 n l 8 3 2 5 4 9 6 7" by default, unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/man_db.conf), and to show only the first page found, even if page  exists  in  several
       sections.

--
       Conventional  section  names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT, FILES, VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAM-
       PLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

/bin/mandb
DESCRIPTION
       mandb  is  used  to initialise or manually update index database caches that are usually maintained by man.  The caches contain information relevant to the current state of the manual page
       system and the information stored within them is used by the man-db utilities to enhance their speed and functionality.

       When creating or updating an index, mandb will warn of bad ROFF .so requests, bogus manual page filenames and manual pages from which the whatis cannot be parsed.

/bin/mkfontdir
DESCRIPTION
       For  each  directory  argument, mkfontdir reads all of the font files in the directory searching for properties named "FONT", or (failing that) the name of the file stripped of its suffix.
       These are converted to lower case and used as font names, and, along with the name of the font file, are written out to the file "fonts.dir" in the directory.  The X server and font server
       use "fonts.dir" to find font files.

       The  kinds  of font files read by mkfontdir depend on configuration parameters, but typically include PCF (suffix ".pcf"), SNF (suffix ".snf") and BDF (suffix ".bdf").  If a font exists in

/bin/mkfontscale
DESCRIPTION
       For each directory argument, mkfontscale reads all of the scalable font files in the directory.  For every font file found, an X11 font name (XLFD) is generated, and  is  written  together
       with the file name to a file fonts.scale in the directory.

       The resulting fonts.scale file should be checked and possibly manually edited before being used as input for the mkfontdir(1) program.

#######################################
/bin/mkgroup
DESCRIPTION
       The  mkgroup program can be used to help configure Cygwin by creating a  /etc/group file.  Its use is essential to include Windows security information.

       The  command  is initially called by  setup.exe to create a default  /etc/group.  This should be sufficient in most circumstances.  However, especially when working in a multi-domain envi-
       ronment, you can use  mkgroup manually to create a more complete  /etc/group file for all domains.  Especially when you have the same group name used on multiple machines  or  in  multiple
       domains, you can use the  -D, -L and  -C options to create unique domain\group style groupnames.

       The  mkpasswd program can be used to help configure Cygwin by creating a  /etc/passwd from your system information. Its use is essential to include Windows security information.   However,
       the actual passwords are determined by Windows, not by the content of /etc/passwd.

       The  command is initially called by  setup.exe to create a default  /etc/passwd.  This should be sufficient in most circumstances.  However, especially when working in a multi-domain envi-
       ronment, you can use  mkpasswd manually to create a more complete  /etc/passwd file for all domains.  Especially when you have the same user name used on multiple machines or  in  multiple

/bin/mount
DESCRIPTION
       The  mount program is used to map your drives and shares onto Cygwin's simulated POSIX directory tree, much like as is done by mount commands on typical UNIX systems.  However, in contrast
       to mount points given in  /etc/fstab, mount points created or changed with  mount are not persistent.  They disappear immediately after the last process of the current user exited.  Please
       see  mount-table /xref for more information on the concepts behind the Cygwin POSIX file system and strategies for using mounts. To remove mounts temporarily, use  umount

       If you just type  mount with no parameters, it will display the current mount table for you.

/bin/namei
DESCRIPTION
       namei  uses its arguments as pathnames to any type of Unix file (symlinks, files, directories, and so forth).  namei then follows each pathname until an endpoint is found (a file, a direc-
       tory, a device node, etc).  If it finds a symbolic link, it shows the link, and starts following it, indenting the output to show the context.

       This program is useful for finding "too many levels of symbolic links" problems.

/bin/nano
DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the nano command.

       nano  is  a  small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace Pico, the default editor included in the non-free Pine package.  Rather than just copying Pico's look and feel, nano also
       implements some missing (or disabled by default) features in Pico, such as "search and replace" and "go to line and column number".

/bin/nc
DESCRIPTION
     The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets.  It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP
     and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with both IPv4 and IPv6.  Unlike telnet(1), nc scripts nicely, and separates error messages onto standard error instead of sending them to standard
     output, as telnet(1) does with some.

     Common uses include:

/bin/nroff
DESCRIPTION
       The  nroff  script  emulates the nroff command using groff.  Only ascii, latin1, utf8, and cp1047 are devices accepted by nroff to select the output encoding emitted by grotty, groff's TTY
       output device.  If neither the GROFF_TYPESETTER environment variable nor the -T command line option (which overrides the environment variable) specifies a (valid) device, nroff checks  the
       current  locale  to  select  a default output device.  It first tries the locale program, then the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and finally the LESSCHARSET environment
       variable.

/bin/objcopy
DESCRIPTION
       The GNU objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another.  objcopy uses the GNU BFD Library to read and write the object files.  It can write the destination object file in
       a format different from that of the source object file.  The exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options.  Note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file
       between any two formats. However, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats may not work as expected.

       objcopy creates temporary files to do its translations and deletes them afterward.  objcopy uses BFD to do all its translation work; it has access to all the formats described in BFD and

/bin/objdump
DESCRIPTION
       objdump displays information about one or more object files.  The options control what particular information to display.  This information is mostly useful to programmers who are working
       on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work.

       objfile... are the object files to be examined.  When you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.

       in languages that don't use the standard Western-European encoding (ISO 8859-1).


SUMMARY USAGE
#######################################
/bin/oldfind
DESCRIPTION
       The  oldfind  and  find  programs are functionally identical.  The only difference between them is the implementation internals of how the filesystem is searched.  The oldfind binary has a
       recursive implementation while find uses fts(3).  The fts-based implementation will replace the recursive implementation but for the moment both implementations are installed.

       The implementation which is installed as find on this system is the fts-based implementation, since the --without-fts option was not passed to  the  configure  script  when  findutils  was
       built.

#######################################
/bin/pamendian
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       All  Netpbm formats that have samples in pure binary format with multiple bytes are defined to have them in big endian (most significant byte first) order.  However, there exist variations
       on these formats, primarily developed before official multibyte Netpbm formats existed, that are identical to Netpbm formats in every respect except  that  samples  are  in  little  endian
       (least significant byte first) order.
#######################################
/bin/pamenlarge
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pamenlarge reads a Netpbm image as input, replicates its pixels N times, and produces a Netpbm image as output.  The output is the same type of image as the input.

       If you enlarge by a factor of 3 or more, you should probably add a pnmsmooth step; otherwise, you can see the original pixels in the resulting image.

/bin/pamstereogram
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pamstereogram  inputs  a  depth  map (a map of the distances from your eye of the points in a scene) and outputs a single-image stereogram (SIS). A SIS is a 2-D image specially designed to
       appear three dimensional when viewed with relaxed, slightly unfocused eyes. What's exciting about single-image stereograms is that they don't require special glasses to view,  although  it
       does  require  a bit of practice to train your eyes to unfocus properly.  The pamstereogram program provides a wealth of control over how the stereogram is generated, including the follow-

/bin/pamstretch-gen
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pamstretch-gen is a program which uses pamstretch(1) , pnmfile(1) , and pamscale(1)
        to smoothly scale up a PNM file by any ratio; it's like a more general version of pamstretch (hence the name). But other than the `any ratio' bit, it's much the same as pamstretch. :-)

#######################################
/bin/pamstretch
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pamstretch  scales up pictures by integer values, either vertically, horizontally, or both.  pamstretch  differs from pamscale and pamenlarge in that when it inserts  the  additional  rows
       and  columns,  instead of making the new row or column a copy of its neighbor, pamstretch makes the new row or column an interpolation between its neighbors.  In some images, this produces
       better looking output.

/bin/passwd
DESCRIPTION
         passwd changes passwords for user accounts. A normal user may only change the password for their own account, but administrators may change passwords on any account. passwd also  changes
       account information, such as password expiry dates and intervals.

       For  password  changes,  the user is first prompted for their old password, if one is present.  This password is then encrypted and compared against the stored password.  The user has only
       one chance to enter the correct password.  The administrators are permitted to bypass this step so that forgotten passwords may be changed.

/bin/patch
DESCRIPTION
       patch  takes  a  patch  file patchfile containing a difference listing produced by the diff program and applies those differences to one or more original files, producing patched versions.
       Normally the patched versions are put in place of the originals.  Backups can be made; see the -b or --backup option.  The names of the files to be patched are usually taken from the patch
       file, but if there's just one file to be patched it can be specified on the command line as originalfile.

       Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff listing, unless overruled by a -c (--context), -e (--ed), -n (--normal), or -u (--unified) option.  Context diffs (old-style,

DESCRIPTION
       pdfroff  is a wrapper program for the GNU text processing system, groff.  It transparently handles the mechanics of multiple pass groff processing, when applied to suitably marked up groff
       source files, such that tables of contents and body text are formatted separately, and are subsequently combined in the correct order, for final publication as a single  PDF  document.   A
       further optional "style sheet" capability is provided; this allows for the definition of content which is required to precede the table of contents, in the published document.

       For each invocation of pdfroff, the ultimate groff output stream is post-processed by the GhostScript interpreter, to produce a finished PDF document.

DESCRIPTION
       Perl officially stands for Practical Extraction and Report Language, except when it doesn't.

       Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on that information.  It quickly became
       a good language for many system management tasks. Over the years, Perl has grown into a general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for everything from quick "one-liners" to
       full-scale application development.

/bin/pg
DESCRIPTION
       pg  displays  a  text file on a CRT one screenful at once.  After each page, a prompt is displayed.  The user may then either press the newline key to view the next page or one of the keys
       described below.

       If no filename is given on the command line, pg reads from standard input.  If standard output is not a terminal, pg acts like cat(1) but precedes each file with its name if there is  more
       than one.

/bin/pgmcrater
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pgmcrater  creates  a PGM image which mimics cratered terrain.  The PGM image is created by simulating the impact of a given number of craters with random position and size, then rendering
       the resulting terrain elevations based on a light source shining from one side of the screen.  The size distribution of the craters is based on a power law which results in many more small
       craters  than  large ones.  The number of craters of a given size varies as the reciprocal of the area as described on pages 31 and 32 of Peitgen and Saupe[1]; cratered bodies in the Solar
#######################################
/bin/pgmdeshadow
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pgmdeshadow  removes  gray  shadows from an image.  This is useful for an image containing text, such as a scanned book pages, where a shadow typically appears near the book crease or near
       one side of the image.  pgmdeshadow recognizes a gray shadow as an area of smoothly changing color, starting from the outer edges of the image.  The program uses a simple image reconstruc-
       tion algorithm to determine the local shadow gray level, then divides each pixel's gray level by the local shadow gray level.

DESCRIPTION
       The  DARPA  Internet  is  a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, connected together by gateways.  Tracking a single-point hardware or software failure can often be difficult.
       Ping utilizes the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.  ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have an IP  and  ICMP  header,
       followed  by  a  struct timeval, and then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.  Default datagram length is 64 bytes, but this may be changed using the command-
       line option.  Other options are:

/bin/plot
DESCRIPTION
       plot  translates files in GNU metafile format to other graphics formats, or displays them on an X Window System display.  GNU metafile format is a device-independent format for the storage
       of graphic data.  It is the default output format of the programs graph(1), pic2plot(1), tek2plot(1), and plotfont(1), and is further documented in plot(5), since it is an enhanced version
       of the traditional plot(5) format found on non-GNU systems.  It can also be produced by the GNU libplot 2-D graphics export library (see plot(3)).

       The  output  format  is specified with the -T option.  The possible output formats and display types are the same as those supported by graph(1), plotfont(1), pic2plot(1), and tek2plot(1).
#######################################
/bin/plotfont
DESCRIPTION
       plotfont  produces  a  character  map  for any font that is supported by the plotting utilities, which include graph(1), plot(1), pic2plot(1), tek2plot(1), and the GNU libplot 2-D graphics
       export library (see plot(3)).  Which fonts are supported depends on the output format, which is specified by the -T option.  A listing of the fonts available in any specified output format
       may be obtained with the --help-fonts option (see below).

       The character map, or maps, will be written to standard output in the specified format.  For example, the Times-Roman font is available when producing Postscript output.  The command plot-

/bin/pnmcolormap
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pnmcolormap  reads  a  PNM  or  PAM image as input, chooses ncolors colors to best represent the image and writes a PNM color map defining them as output.  A PAM image may actually contain
       tuples of any kind, but pnmcolormap's concept of the tuple values that best represent the ones present in the image may not make sense if the tuple type isn't RGB or GRAYSCALE.  The design
       of the program, and the rest of this manual, assumes the tuples represent colors.

/bin/pnmremap
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pnmremap replaces the colors in an input image with those from a palette you specify.  Where colors in the input are present in the palette, they just stay the same  in  the  output.   But
       where the input contains a color that is not in the palette, pnmremap gives you these choices:

#######################################
/bin/pnmscalefixed
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pnmscalefixed is like pamscale except that it uses fixed point arithmetic internally instead of floating point, which makes it run faster.  In turn, it is less accurate and may distort the
       image.  It also lacks many of the features of pamscale.

#######################################
/bin/pnmtopnm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pnmtopnm  simply  copies  a PNM image to Standard Output.  The output has the same major PNM format (PBM, PGM, or PPM) and maxval as the input.  This may seem an unnecessary duplication of
       cat, but it lets you convert between the plain (ASCII) and raw (binary) subformats of PNM.  Use the -plain Netpbm common option to ensure the output is plain PNM, and don't use  -plain  to
       ensure the output is raw PNM.  See

/bin/ppmntsc
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       This  program  makes  colors  legal  in the NTSC (or PAL) color systems.  Often, images generated on the computer are made for use in movies which ultimately end up on a television screen.
       However, the range of colors (as specified by their RGB values) on a computer does not match the range of colors that can be represented using the NTSC (or PAL) systems.  If an image  with
       'illegal' colors is sent directly to an NTSC (or PAL) video system for recording, the 'illegal' colors will be clipped.  This may result in an undesirable looking picture.

/bin/ppmquantall
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       ppmquantall  was  obsoleted  by pnmquantall(1) , introduced with Netpbm 10.58 (March 2012).  pnmquantall is just a renaming to reflect the fact that the program handles all kinds of Netpbm
       input files, not just PPM.  Though this was not always the case, it had been for many years before the renaming.

#######################################
/bin/ppmrainbow
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       ppmrainbow  generates  a PPM image that fades from one color to another to another from left to right, like a rainbow.  The colors are those you specify on the command line, in that order.

/bin/ps
DESCRIPTION
       The   ps  program gives the status of all the Cygwin processes running on the system (ps = "process status").  Due to the limitations of simulating a POSIX environment under Windows, there
       is little information to give.

        The PID column is the process ID you need to give to the  kill command. The PPID is the parent process ID, and PGID is the process group ID.  The WINPID column is  the  process   ID  dis-
       played  by NT's Task Manager program. The TTY column gives which  pseudo-terminal a process is running on, or a  '?' for services. The UID column shows which user owns each process.  STIME

/bin/ps2ascii
DESCRIPTION
       ps2ascii  uses  gs(1)  to extract ASCII text from PostScript(tm) or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) files. If no files are specified on the command line, gs reads from standard input;
       but PDF input must come from an explicitly-named file, not standard input.  If no output file is specified, the ASCII text is written to standard output.

       ps2ascii doesn't look at font encoding, and isn't very good at dealing with kerning, so for PostScript (but not currently PDF), you might consider pstotext (see below).

#######################################
/bin/ps2eps
#######################################
/bin/ps2epsi
DESCRIPTION
       ps2epsi  uses  gs(1) to process a PostScript(tm) file and generate as output a new file which conforms to Adobe's Encapsulated PostScript Interchange (EPSI) format.  EPSI is a special form
       of encapsulated PostScript (EPS) which adds to the beginning of the file in the form of PostScript comments a bitmapped version of the final displayed page.  Programs which understand EPSI
       (usually word processors or DTP programs) can use this bitmap to give a preview version on screen of the PostScript.  The displayed quality is often not very good (e.g., low resolution, no
       colours), but the final printed version uses the real PostScript, and thus has the normal PostScript quality.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pstopnm reads a PostScript file as input and produces PBM, PGM, or PPM images as output.  This program simply uses GhostScript to render a PostScript file with its PNM device drivers.   If
       you  don't  have GhostScript installed or the version you have installed was not built with the relevant PNM device drivers, pstopnm will fail.  You can see if you have the proper environ-
       ment by issuing the command gs --help .  If it responds and lists under 'Available Devices' pbm, pbmraw, pgm, pgmraw, pnm, pnmraw, ppm, or ppmraw, you're in business.

/bin/pstotext
DESCRIPTION
       pstotext  reads  one  or  more PostScript or PDF files, and writes to standard output a representation of the plain text that would be displayed if the PostScript file were printed.  As is
       described in the DETAILS section below, this representation is only an approximation.  Nevertheless, it is often useful for information retrieval  (e.g.,  running  grep(1)  or  building  a
       full-text index) or to recover the text from a PostScript file whose source you have lost.

       pstotext  calls  Ghostscript,  and  requires Aladdin Ghostscript version 3.51 or newer.  Ghostscript must be invokable on the current search path as gs.  Alternatively, you can use the -gs

           This effectively lets you view changes made to an archives contents.

#######################################
/bin/ptargrep
DESCRIPTION
       This utility allows you to apply pattern matching to the contents of files contained in a tar archive.  You might use this to identify all files in an archive which contain lines matching
       the specified pattern and either print out the pathnames or extract the files.

       The pattern will be used as a Perl regular expression (as opposed to a simple grep regex).

DESCRIPTION
       Python  is  an  interpreted,  interactive, object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.  For an introduction to programming in Python you are
       referred to the Python Tutorial.  The Python Library Reference documents built-in and standard types, constants, functions and modules.  Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes  the
       syntax and semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.  (These documents may be located via the INTERNET RESOURCES below; they may be installed on your system as well.)

       Python's  basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded.  Python is also adaptable as an extension language

/bin/qcmd
DESCRIPTION
       This manual page document describes the qcp, qmv and qcmd commands.

       The  qmv  program  allows files to be renamed by editing their names in any text editor. By changing a letter in a text document, a letter in a filename can be changed. Since the files are
       listed after each other, common changes can be made more quickly.

/bin/rake
DESCRIPTION
       rake has the following features:

       * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
         standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
         syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
#######################################
/bin/ranlib
DESCRIPTION
       ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.

       You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index.

       An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive.
#######################################
/bin/ras2tiff
DESCRIPTION
       ras2tiff  converts  a  file  in the Sun rasterfile format to TIFF.  By default, the TIFF image is created with data samples packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed with the Lempel-Ziv &
       Welch algorithm (Compression=5), and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.  These characteristics can overridden, or explicitly specified with the options described below.

       Any colormap information in the rasterfile is carried over to the TIFF file by including a Colormap tag in the output file.  If the rasterfile has a colormap, the PhotometricInterpretation
       tag is set to 3 (palette); otherwise it is set to 2 (RGB) if the depth is 24 or 1 (min-is-black) if the depth is not 24.
#######################################
/bin/rasttopnm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       rasttopnm  reads  a  Sun  rasterfile  as  input and produces a PNM image as output.  The type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's black and white, rasttopnm writes a PBM
       image.  If it's grayscale, rasttopnm writes a PGM.  If it's color, rasttopnm writes a PPM.  The program tells you which type it is generating.

#######################################
/bin/raw2tiff
DESCRIPTION
       raw2tiff  converts  a raw byte sequence into TIFF.  By default, the TIFF image is created with data samples packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed with the PackBits algorithm (Compres-
       sion=32773), and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.  These characteristics can overridden, or explicitly specified with the options described below.

#######################################
/bin/rawtopgm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       rawtopgm  reads  raw grayscale values as input and produces a PGM image as output.  The input file is just a sequence of pure binary numbers, either one or two bytes each, either bigendian
       or littleendian, representing gray values.  They may be arranged either top to bottom, left to right or bottom to top, left to right.  There may be  arbitrary  header  information  at  the
       start of the file (to which rawtopgm pays no attention at all other than the header's size).
#######################################
/bin/rawtoppm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       rawtoppm  reads  raw RGB bytes as input and produces a PPM image as output.  The input file is just RGB bytes.  You have to specify the width and height on the command line, since the pro-
       gram obviously can't get them from the file.  rawtoppm assumes the maxval of the input samples is 255, and makes the maxval of the output PPM 255.

#######################################
/bin/rdjpgcom
DESCRIPTION
       rdjpgcom reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard input if no file is named, and prints any text comments found in the file on the standard output.

       The  JPEG standard allows "comment" (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG file.  Although the standard doesn't actually define what COM blocks are for, they are widely used to hold user-sup-
       plied text strings.  This lets you add annotations, titles, index terms, etc to your JPEG files, and later retrieve them as text.  COM blocks do not interfere with the image stored in  the
       JPEG file.  The maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you can have as many of them as you like in one JPEG file.

/bin/rediff
DESCRIPTION
       You can use rediff to correct a hand-edited unified diff. Take a copy of the diff you want to edit, and edit it without changing any offsets or counts (the lines that begin "@@"). Then run
       rediff, telling it the name of the original diff file and the name of the one you have edited, and it will output the edited diff file but with corrected offsets and counts.

       A small script, editdiff, is provided for editing a diff file in-place.

#######################################
/bin/refer
DESCRIPTION
       This  file  documents  the  GNU version of refer, which is part of the groff document formatting system.  refer copies the contents of filename... to the standard output, except that lines
       between .[ and .] are interpreted as citations, and lines between .R1 and .R2 are interpreted as commands about how citations are to be processed.

       Each citation specifies a reference.  The citation can specify a reference that is contained in a bibliographic database by giving a set of keywords  that  only  that  reference  contains.
       Alternatively it can specify a reference by supplying a database record in the citation.  A combination of these alternatives is also possible.
#######################################
/bin/regtool
DESCRIPTION
       The  regtool program allows shell scripts to access and modify the Windows registry.  Note that modifying the Windows registry is dangerous, and carelessness here can result in an unusable
       system.  Be careful.

       The  -v option means "verbose".  For most commands, this causes additional or lengthier messages to be printed. Conversely, the  -q option supresses error messages, so you can use the exit
       status of the program to detect if a key exists or not (for example).
#######################################
/bin/rename
DESCRIPTION
       rename will rename the specified files by replacing the first occurrence of expression in their name by replacement.

#######################################
/bin/renice
DESCRIPTION
       renice  alters  the  scheduling  priority  of  one  or more running processes.  The first argument is the priority value to be used.  The other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by
       default), process group IDs, user IDs, or user names.  renice'ing a process group causes all processes in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered.   renice'ing  a  user
       causes all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority altered.

/bin/rgb2ycbcr
DESCRIPTION
       rgb2ycbcr  converts  RGB  color, greyscale, or bi-level TIFF images to YCbCr images by transforming and sampling pixel data. If multiple files are specified on the command line each source
       file is converted to a separate directory in the destination file.

       By default, chrominance samples are created by sampling 2 by 2 blocks of luminance values; this can be changed with the -h and -v options.  Output data are  compressed  with  the  PackBits
       compression  scheme, by default; an alternate scheme can be selected with the -c option.  By default, output data are compressed in strips with the number of rows in each strip selected so

       Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).  Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC
       VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets).
       There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions between windows.

       When  screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you normally would.  Then,

/bin/script
DESCRIPTION
       script  makes a typescript of everything displayed on your terminal.  It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session as proof of an assignment, as the type-
       script file can be printed out later with lpr(1).

       If the argument file is given, script saves the dialogue in this file.  If no filename is given, the dialogue is saved in the file typescript.

#######################################
/bin/scriptreplay
DESCRIPTION
       This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.

       The  replay  simply  displays  the  information again; the programs that were run when the typescript was being recorded are not run again.  Since the same information is simply being dis-
       played, scriptreplay is only guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on.  Otherwise, any escape characters  in  the  typescript  may  be
       interpreted differently by the terminal to which scriptreplay is sending its output.
#######################################
/bin/sdiff
DESCRIPTION
       Side-by-side merge of differences between FILE1 and FILE2.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -o, --output=FILE
#######################################
/bin/sed
DESCRIPTION
       Sed  is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which
       permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to filter text in  a  pipeline  which
       particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

#######################################
/bin/sftp
DESCRIPTION
     sftp is an interactive file transfer program, similar to ftp(1), which performs all operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport.  It may also use many features of ssh, such as public key
     authentication and compression.  sftp connects and logs into the specified host, then enters an interactive command mode.

     The second usage format will retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after successful interactive authentication.

#######################################
/bin/sgitopnm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       sgitopnm reads an SGI image file as input and produces a PGM image for a 2-dimensional (1 channel) input file, and a PPM image for a 3-dimensional (3 or more channels) input file.

       Alternatively, the program produces a PGM image of any one of the channels in the input file.
#######################################
/bin/sgrep
DESCRIPTION
       sgrep  (structured  grep)  is  a  tool for searching text files and filtering text streams using structural criteria.  The data model of sgrep is based on regions, which are non-empty sub-
       strings of text.  Regions are typically occurrences of constant strings or meaningful text elements, which are recognizable through some delimiting strings.   Regions  can  be  arbitrarily
       long, arbitrarily overlapping, and arbitrarily nested.

       sgrep uses patterns called region expressions to express which regions of the input text are output to standard output. The selection of regions is based on mutual containment and ordering
#######################################
/bin/sh
DESCRIPTION
       Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells
       (ksh and csh).

       Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).  Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant
       by default.

/bin/shasum
DESCRIPTION
       Running shasum is often the quickest way to compute SHA message digests.  The user simply feeds data to the script through files or standard input, and then collects the results from
       standard output.

       The following command shows how easy it is to compute digests for typical inputs such as the NIST test vector "abc":

#######################################
/bin/sirtopnm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       sirtopnm  reads  a Solitaire Image Recorder file as input and produces a PNM image as output.  The type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's an MGI TYPE 17 file, sirtopnm
       generates a PGM file.  If it's an MGI TYPE 11 file, sirtopnm generates PPM.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

#######################################
/bin/sitecopy
DESCRIPTION
       sitecopy is for copying locally stored web sites to remote web servers.  A single command will upload files to the server which have changed locally, and delete files from the server which
       have been removed locally, to keep the remote site synchronized with the local site.  The aim is to remove the hassle of uploading and deleting individual files using an FTP client.  site-
       copy will also optionally try to spot files you move locally, and move them remotely.

       FTP, SFTP, WebDAV and other HTTP-based authoring servers (for instance, AOLserver and Netscape Enterprise) are supported.
#######################################
/bin/size
DESCRIPTION
       The GNU size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list.  By default, one line of output is generated for
       each object file or each module in an archive.

       objfile... are the object files to be examined.  If none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.

/bin/skill
DESCRIPTION
       These tools are probably obsolete and unportable. The command syntax is poorly defined. Consider using the killall, pkill, and pgrep commands instead.

       The default signal for skill is TERM. Use -l or -L to list available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in
       three ways: -9 -SIGKILL -KILL.

#######################################
/bin/slabtop
DESCRIPTION
       slabtop(1)  displays detailed kernel slab cache information in real time.  It displays a listing of the top caches sorted by one of the listed sort criteria.  It also displays a statistics
       header filled with slab layer information.

/bin/sldtoppm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       sldtoppm  reads  an  AutoCAD(R) slide file and outputs a PPM image.  If you don't specify slidefile, sldtoppm reads input from Standard Input.  sldtoppm uses the ppmdraw library to convert
       the vector and polygon information in the slide file to a raster; see the file ppmdraw.h for details on this package.

#######################################
/bin/sleep
DESCRIPTION
       Pause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be 's' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.  Unlike most implementations that require NUMBER be an integer, here
       NUMBER may be an arbitrary floating point number.  Given two or more arguments, pause for the amount of time specified by the sum of their values.

       --help display this help and exit

#######################################
/bin/slogin
DESCRIPTION
     ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to replace rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted commu-
     nications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user name).  The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods depending on the proto-
     col version used (see below).

/bin/splain
DESCRIPTION
   The "diagnostics" Pragma
       This module extends the terse diagnostics normally emitted by both the perl compiler and the perl interpreter (from running perl with a -w switch or "use warnings"), augmenting them with
       the more explicative and endearing descriptions found in perldiag.  Like the other pragmata, it affects the compilation phase of your program rather than merely the execution phase.

       To use in your program as a pragma, merely invoke
#######################################
/bin/spline
DESCRIPTION
       spline  reads  datasets  from  standard  input or from one or more files, and fits a smooth curve (a "spline") through each dataset.  An interpolated version of each dataset, consisting of
       points from the smooth curve, is written to standard output.

       Unless the -a or -A options are used (see below), each dataset should be a sequence of values for a vector-valued function of a single scalar variable.  That is, each dataset should  be  a
       sequence  of  data points, given as alternating t and y values.  t is a scalar independent variable, and y is a vector-valued dependent variable.  The dimensionality of y is specified with

/bin/split
DESCRIPTION
       Output fixed-size pieces of INPUT to PREFIXaa, PREFIXab, ...; default size is 1000 lines, and default PREFIX is 'x'.  With no INPUT, or when INPUT is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --suffix-length=N
#######################################
/bin/splitdiff
DESCRIPTION
       If you have a patch file composed of several incremental patches, you can use splitdiff to separate them out. You may want to do this in preparation for re-combining them with
       combinediff(1).

       The effect of running splitdiff is to separate its input into a set of output files, with no output file patching the same file more than once.

/bin/ssh-add
DESCRIPTION
     ssh-add adds private key identities to the authentication agent, ssh-agent(1).  When run without arguments, it adds the files ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     and ~/.ssh/identity.  After loading a private key, ssh-add will try to load corresponding certificate information from the filename obtained by appending -cert.pub to the name of the private
     key file.  Alternative file names can be given on the command line.

     If any file requires a passphrase, ssh-add asks for the passphrase from the user.  The passphrase is read from the user's tty.  ssh-add retries the last passphrase if multiple identity files
#######################################
/bin/ssh-agent
DESCRIPTION
     ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ED25519).  ssh-agent is usually started in the beginning of an X-session or a login session,
     and all other windows or programs are started as clients to the ssh-agent program.  Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and automatically used for authentication
     when logging in to other machines using ssh(1).

     The agent initially does not have any private keys.  Keys are added using ssh-add(1).  Multiple identities may be stored in ssh-agent concurrently and ssh(1) will automatically use them if
#######################################
/bin/ssh-copy-id
DESCRIPTION
     ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh(1) to log into a remote machine (presumably using a login password, so password authentication should be enabled, unless you've done some clever use of
     multiple identities).  It assembles a list of one or more fingerprints (as described below) and tries to log in with each key, to see if any of them are already installed (of course, if you
     are not using ssh-agent(1) this may result in you being repeatedly prompted for pass-phrases).  It then assembles a list of those that failed to log in, and using ssh, enables logins with
     those keys on the remote server.  By default it adds the keys by appending them to the remote user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (creating the file, and directory, if necessary).  It is also
     capable of detecting if the remote system is a NetScreen, and using its `set ssh pka-dsa key ...' command instead.
#######################################
/bin/ssh-host-config
#######################################
/bin/ssh-keygen
DESCRIPTION
     ssh-keygen generates, manages and converts authentication keys for ssh(1).  ssh-keygen can create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 1 and DSA, ECDSA, ED25519 or RSA keys for use by
     SSH protocol version 2.  The type of key to be generated is specified with the -t option.  If invoked without any arguments, ssh-keygen will generate an RSA key for use in SSH protocol 2
     connections.

     ssh-keygen is also used to generate groups for use in Diffie-Hellman group exchange (DH-GEX).  See the MODULI GENERATION section for details.
#######################################
/bin/ssh-keyscan
DESCRIPTION
     ssh-keyscan is a utility for gathering the public ssh host keys of a number of hosts.  It was designed to aid in building and verifying ssh_known_hosts files.  ssh-keyscan provides a minimal
     interface suitable for use by shell and perl scripts.

     ssh-keyscan uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in parallel, so it is very efficient.  The keys from a domain of 1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of sec-
     onds, even when some of those hosts are down or do not run ssh.  For scanning, one does not need login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning process involve

/bin/strings
DESCRIPTION
       For each file given, GNU strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an
       unprintable character.  By default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole
       file.

       strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.
#######################################
/bin/strip
DESCRIPTION
       GNU strip discards all symbols from object files objfile.  The list of object files may include archives.  At least one object file must be given.

       strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

/bin/tailf
DESCRIPTION
       tailf  will  print out the last 10 lines of the given file and then wait for this file to grow.  It is similar to tail -f but does not access the file when it is not growing.  This has the
       side effect of not updating the access time for the file, so a filesystem flush does not occur periodically when no log activity is happening.

       tailf is extremely useful for monitoring log files on a laptop when logging is infrequent and the user desires that the hard disk spin down to conserve battery life.

DESCRIPTION
       Tclsh  is  a shell-like application that reads Tcl commands from its standard input or from a file and evaluates them.  If invoked with no arguments then it runs interactively, reading Tcl
       commands from standard input and printing command results and error messages to standard output.  It runs until the exit command is invoked or until it reaches end-of-file on its  standard
       input.   If there exists a file .tclshrc (or tclshrc.tcl on the Windows platforms) in the home directory of the user, interactive tclsh evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before read-
       ing the first command from standard input.

       mats are the same as those supported by graph(1), plot(1), pic2plot(1), and plotfont(1).  If an output file is produced, it is written to standard output.

       Options and file names may be interspersed on the command line, but the options are processed before the file names are read.  If -- is seen, it is interpreted as the end of  the  options.
       If no file names are specified, or the file name - is encountered, the standard input is read.

/bin/tex
DESCRIPTION
       Run  the  TeX  typesetter  on  file,  usually creating file.dvi.  If the file argument has no extension, ".tex" will be appended to it.  Instead of a filename, a set of TeX commands can be
       given, the first of which must start with a backslash.  With a &format argument TeX uses a different set of precompiled commands, contained in format.fmt; it is usually better to  use  the
       -fmt format option instead.

       TeX  formats the interspersed text and commands contained in the named files and outputs a typesetter independent file (called DVI, which is short for DeVice Independent).  TeX's capabili-

DESCRIPTION
   Introduction
       tex2lyx will create a LyX file with the specified name (or dir/foo.lyx if no name was given) from the LaTeX file dir/foo.tex.

       Suffixes  .tex,  .ltx  and  .latex  are supported. If inputfile does not exist and does not have one of these suffixes, tex2lyx will try to translate inputfile.tex. (This is similar to the
       behavior of LaTeX.)

/bin/thumbnail
DESCRIPTION
       thumbnail  is  a  program written to show how one might use the SubIFD tag (#330) to store thumbnail images.  thumbnail copies a TIFF Class F facsimile file to the output file and for each
       image an 8-bit greyscale thumbnail sketch.  The output file contains the thumbnail image with the associated full-resolution page linked below with the SubIFD tag.

       By default, thumbnail images are 216 pixels wide by 274 pixels high.  Pixels are calculated by sampling and filtering the input image with each pixel value passed through a contrast curve.

       The tic command translates a terminfo file from source format into compiled format.  The compiled format is necessary for use with the library routines in ncurses(3X).

       As  described  in  term(5),  the database may be either a directory tree (one file per terminal entry) or a hashed database (one record per entry).  The tic command writes only one type of
       entry, depending on how it was built:

/bin/tie
DESCRIPTION
       You use "Tie::Cycle" to go through a list over and over again.  Once you get to the end of the list, you go back to the beginning.  You don't have to worry about any of this since the
       magic of tie does that for you.

       The tie takes an array reference as its third argument. The tie should succeed unless the argument is not an array reference.  Previous versions required you to use an array that had more
       than one element (what's the pointing of looping otherwise?), but I've removed that restriction since the number of elements you want to use may change depending on the situation.
#######################################
/bin/tiff2bw
DESCRIPTION
       Tiff2bw  converts  an  RGB or Palette color TIFF image to a greyscale image by combining percentages of the red, green, and blue channels.  By default, output samples are created by taking
       28% of the red channel, 59% of the green channel, and 11% of the blue channel.  To alter these percentages, the -R, -G, and -B options may be used.

OPTIONS

#######################################
/bin/tiff2pdf
DESCRIPTION
       tiff2pdf opens a TIFF image and writes a PDF document to standard output.

       The  program converts one TIFF file to one PDF file, including multiple page TIFF files, tiled TIFF files, black and white. grayscale, and color TIFF files that contain data of TIFF photo-
       metric interpretations of bilevel, grayscale, RGB, YCbCr, CMYK separation, and ICC L*a*b* as supported by libtiff and PDF.

#######################################
/bin/tiff2ps
DESCRIPTION
       tiff2ps  reads  TIFF  images  and  writes PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) on the standard output.  By default, tiff2ps writes Encapsulated PostScript for the first image in the
       specified TIFF image file.

       By default, tiff2ps will generate PostScript that fills a printed area specified by the TIFF tags in the input file.  If the file does not contain XResolution or YResolution tags, then the
       printed  area  is  set  according  to the image dimensions.  The -w and -h options (see below) can be used to set the dimensions of the printed area in inches; overriding any relevant TIFF
#######################################
/bin/tiff2rgba
DESCRIPTION
       Tiff2rgba  converts  a wide variety of TIFF images into an RGBA TIFF image.  This includes the ability to translate different color spaces and photometric interpretation into RGBA, support
       for alpha blending, and translation of many different bit depths into a 32bit RGBA image.

       Internally this program is implemented using the TIFFReadRGBAImage() function, and it suffers any limitations of that image.  This includes limited support for >  8  BitsPerSample  images,
       and flaws with some esoteric combinations of BitsPerSample, photometric interpretation, block organization and planar configuration.
#######################################
/bin/tiffcmp
DESCRIPTION
       Tiffcmp  compares  the  tags  and data in two files created according to the Tagged Image File Format, Revision 6.0.  The schemes used for compressing data in each file are immaterial when
       data are compared-data are compared on a scanline-by-scanline basis after decompression.  Most directory tags are checked; notable exceptions  are:  GrayResponseCurve,  ColorResponseCurve,
       and  ColorMap  tags.   Data  will not be compared if any of the BitsPerSample, SamplesPerPixel, or ImageWidth values are not equal.  By default, tiffcmp will terminate if it encounters any
       difference.

#######################################
/bin/tiffcp
DESCRIPTION
       tiffcp  combines  one or more files created according to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0 into a single TIFF file.  Because the output file may be compressed using a different algo-
       rithm than the input files, tiffcp is most often used to convert between different compression schemes.

       By default, tiffcp will copy all the understood tags in a TIFF directory of an input file to the associated directory in the output file.

#######################################
/bin/tiffcrop
DESCRIPTION
       Tiffcrop processes one or more files created according to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, specification into one or more TIFF file(s).  Tiffcrop is most often used to extract por-
       tions of an image for processing with bar code recognizer or OCR software when that software cannot restrict the region of interest to a specific portion of the image or to  improve  effi-
       ciency  when  the  regions of interest must be rotated.  It can also be used to subdivide all or part of a processed image into smaller sections and export individual images or sections of
       images as separate files or separate images within one or more files derived from the original input image or images.

/bin/tiffdump
DESCRIPTION
       tiffdump  displays  directory information from files created according to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0.  The header of each TIFF file (magic number, version, and first directory
       offset) is displayed, followed by the tag contents of each directory in the file.  For each tag, the name, data type, count, and value(s) is displayed.  When the symbolic name for a tag or
       data  type  is  known, the symbolic name is displayed followed by it's numeric (decimal) value.  Tag values are displayed enclosed in ``<>'' characters immediately preceded by the value of
       the count field.  For example, an ImageWidth tag might be displayed as ``ImageWidth (256) SHORT (3) 1<800>''.

#######################################
/bin/tiffinfo
DESCRIPTION
       Tiffinfo displays information about files created according to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0.  By default, the contents of each TIFF directory in each file is displayed, with the
       value of each tag shown symbolically (where sensible).

OPTIONS
       -c     Display the colormap and color/gray response curves, if present.
#######################################
/bin/tiffmedian
DESCRIPTION
       tiffmedian  applies  the  median cut algorithm to an RGB image in input.tif to generate a palette image that is written to output.tif.  The generated colormap has, by default, 256 entries.
       The image data is quantized by mapping each pixel to the closest color values in the colormap.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify the compression to use for data written to the output file: none for no compression, packbits for PackBits compression, lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch compression, and  zip  for

/bin/tiffsplit
DESCRIPTION
       tiffsplit  takes a multi-directory (page) TIFF file and creates one or more single-directory (page) TIFF files from it.  The output files are given names created by concatenating a prefix,
       a lexically ordered suffix in the range [aaa-zzz], the suffix .tif (e.g.  xaaa.tif, xaab.tif, ..., xzzz.tif).  If a prefix is not specified on the command line, the default prefix of x  is
       used.

/bin/tifftopnm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       tifftopnm  reads a TIFF file as input and produces a PNM image as output.  The type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's black and white, tifftopnm generates a PBM image;
       if it's grayscale, it generates a PGM image; otherwise, the output is PPM.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

#######################################
/bin/u2d
DESCRIPTION
       The Dos2unix package includes utilities "dos2unix" and "unix2dos" to convert plain text files in DOS or Mac format to Unix format and vice versa.

       In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination of two characters: a Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix text files a line break is a
       single character: the Line Feed (LF). In Mac text files, prior to Mac OS X, a line break was single Carriage Return (CR) character. Nowadays Mac OS uses Unix style (LF) line breaks.

#######################################
/bin/ul
DESCRIPTION
       ul  reads  the named files (or standard input if none are given) and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified
       by the environment variable TERM.  The terminfo database is read to determine the appropriate sequences for underlining.  If the terminal is incapable of underlining but is  capable  of  a
       standout mode, then that is used instead.  If the terminal can overstrike, or handles underlining automatically, ul degenerates to cat(1).  If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is
       ignored.

/bin/umount
DESCRIPTION
       The  umount program removes mounts from the mount table in the current session.  If you specify a POSIX path that corresponds to a current mount point,  umount will remove it from the cur-
       rent mount table.  Note that you can only remove user mount points.  The  -U flag may be used to specify removing all user mount points from the current user session.

       See  mount-table /xref for more information on the mount table.

/bin/unix2dos
DESCRIPTION
       The Dos2unix package includes utilities "dos2unix" and "unix2dos" to convert plain text files in DOS or Mac format to Unix format and vice versa.

       In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination of two characters: a Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix text files a line break is a
       single character: the Line Feed (LF). In Mac text files, prior to Mac OS X, a line break was single Carriage Return (CR) character. Nowadays Mac OS uses Unix style (LF) line breaks.

       xz  is a general-purpose data compression tool with command line syntax similar to gzip(1) and bzip2(1).  The native file format is the .xz format, but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA
       Utils and raw compressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.

       xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected operation mode.  If no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard input and writes the processed data  to  stan-
       dard  output.   xz will refuse (display an error and skip the file) to write compressed data to standard output if it is a terminal.  Similarly, xz will refuse to read compressed data from

/bin/unzip
DESCRIPTION
       unzip  will  list, test, or extract files from a ZIP archive, commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  The default behavior (with no options) is to extract into the current directory (and subdi-
       rectories below it) all files from the specified ZIP archive.  A companion program, zip(1L), creates ZIP archives; both programs are compatible with archives created by PKWARE's PKZIP  and
       PKUNZIP for MS-DOS, but in many cases the program options or default behaviors differ.

ARGUMENTS
#######################################
/bin/unzipsfx
DESCRIPTION
       unzipsfx  is  a modified version of unzip(1L) designed to be prepended to existing ZIP archives in order to form self-extracting archives.  Instead of taking its first non-flag argument to
       be the zipfile(s) to be extracted, unzipsfx seeks itself under the name by which it was invoked and tests or extracts the contents of the appended archive.   Because  the  executable  stub
       adds  bulk to the archive (the whole purpose of which is to be as small as possible), a number of the less-vital capabilities in regular unzip have been removed.  Among these are the usage
       (or help) screen, the listing and diagnostic functions (-l and -v), the ability to decompress older compression formats (the ``reduce,'' ``shrink'' and ``implode'' methods).   The  ability
       to  extract  to  a directory other than the current one can be selected as a compile-time option, which is now enabled by default since UnZipSFX version 5.5.  Similarly, decryption is sup-

/bin/update-desktop-database
DESCRIPTION
       The update-desktop-database program is a tool to build a cache database of the MIME types handled by desktop files.

       The  cache database contains the list of MIME types that can be handled by desktop files, as well as, for each MIME type, a list of desktop files that can handle this MIME type. This cache
       database ease the work of applications that need to find an application that can open a document of a specific MIME type: those applications will not have to parse all  the  desktop  files
       existing on the system, and can instead parse this cache database.

/bin/updatedb
DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of updatedb, which updates file name databases used by GNU locate.  The file name databases contain lists of files that were in particular direc-
       tory trees when the databases were last updated.  The file name of the default database is determined when locate and updatedb are configured and installed.  The frequency with  which  the
       databases are updated and the directories for which they contain entries depend on how often updatedb is run, and with which arguments.

       In networked environments, it often makes sense to build a database at the root of each filesystem, containing the entries for that filesystem.  updatedb is then run for each filesystem on

/bin/urxvt
DESCRIPTION
       rxvt-unicode, version 9.20, is a colour vt102 terminal emulator intended as an xterm(1) replacement for users who do not require features such as Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style
       configurability. As a result, rxvt-unicode uses much less swap space -- a significant advantage on a machine serving many X sessions.

/bin/urxvtd
DESCRIPTION
       This manpage describes the urxvtd daemon, which is the same vt102 terminal emulator as urxvt, but runs as a daemon that can open multiple terminal windows within the same process.

       You can run it from your X startup scripts, for example, although it is not dependent on a working DISPLAY and, in fact, can open windows on multiple X displays on the same time.

       Advantages of running a urxvt daemon include faster creation time for terminal windows and a lot of saved memory.

       The  uuidgen program creates (and prints) a new universally unique identifier (UUID) using the libuuid(3) library.  The new UUID can reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created
       on the local system, and among UUIDs created on other systems in the past and in the future.

       There are two types of UUIDs which uuidgen can generate: time-based UUIDs and random-based UUIDs.  By default uuidgen will generate a random-based UUID if a high-quality random number gen-
       erator is present.  Otherwise, it will choose a time-based UUID.  It is possible to force the generation of one of these two UUID types by using the -r or -t options.

DESCRIPTION
       GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.

       Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget
       finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.

/bin/wish
DESCRIPTION
       Wish  is  a  simple program consisting of the Tcl command language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands from standard input or from a file.  It creates a main window and
       then processes Tcl commands.  If wish is invoked with arguments, then the first few arguments, ?-encoding name? ?fileName? specify the name of a script file, and, optionally, the  encoding
       of the text data stored in that script file.  A value for fileName is recognized if the appropriate argument does not start with "-".

       If  there are no arguments, or the arguments do not specify a fileName, then wish reads Tcl commands interactively from standard input.  It will continue processing commands until all win-

       The device is the device file or label offered by the operating system to access the recorder with SCSI GENERIC (sg) interface. Note that some operating systems may provide separate device
       nodes for block-oriented and sg access. For example, on older Linux systems, the sg access was available through /dev/sg...  files while the block oriented access was done through  associ-
       ated (but not identical) /dev/hd...  and /dev/sr...  (or /dev/scd...  ) files.

/bin/wrjpgcom
DESCRIPTION
       wrjpgcom reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard input if no file is named, and generates a new JPEG/JFIF file on standard output.  A comment block is added to the file.

       The  JPEG standard allows "comment" (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG file.  Although the standard doesn't actually define what COM blocks are for, they are widely used to hold user-sup-
       plied text strings.  This lets you add annotations, titles, index terms, etc to your JPEG files, and later retrieve them as text.  COM blocks do not interfere with the image stored in  the
       JPEG file.  The maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you can have as many of them as you like in one JPEG file.

/bin/xmlif
DESCRIPTION
       xmlif filters XML according to conditionalizing markup. This can be useful for formatting one of several versions of an XML document depending on conditions passed to the command.

       Attribute/value pairs from the command line are matched against the attributes associated with certain processing instructions in the document. The instructions are <?xmlif if?> and its
       inverse <?xmlif if not?>, <?xmlif elif?> and its inverse <?xmlif elif not?>, <?xmlif else?>, and <?xmlif fi?>.

#######################################
/bin/xmllint
DESCRIPTION
       The xmllint program parses one or more XML files, specified on the command line as XML-FILE (or the standard input if the filename provided is - ). It prints various types of output,
       depending upon the options selected. It is useful for detecting errors both in XML code and in the XML parser itself.

       xmllint is included in libxml(3).

#######################################
/bin/xmlto
DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of xmlto is to convert an XML file to the desired format using whatever means necessary. This may involve two steps:

        1. The application of an appropriate XSL stylesheet using an XSL-T processor.

        2. Further processing with other tools. This step may not be necessary.
#######################################
/bin/xpmtoppm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

#######################################
/bin/xsltproc
DESCRIPTION
       xsltproc is a command line tool for applying XSLT stylesheets to XML documents. It is part of libxslt(3), the XSLT C library for GNOME. While it was developed as part of the GNOME project,
       it can operate independently of the GNOME desktop.

       xsltproc is invoked from the command line with the name of the stylesheet to be used followed by the name of the file or files to which the stylesheet is to be applied. It will use the
       standard input if a filename provided is - .
#######################################
/bin/xsubpp
DESCRIPTION
       This compiler is typically run by the makefiles created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

       xsubpp will compile XS code into C code by embedding the constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and creates the glue necessary to let Perl access those functions.
       The compiler uses typemaps to determine how to map C function parameters and variables to Perl values.

#######################################
/bin/xvminitoppm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       xvminittoppm reads an XV 'thumbnail' picture (a miniature picture generated by the 'VisualSchnauzer' browser) as input and produces a PPM image as output.


#######################################
/bin/xwdtopnm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       xwdtopnm  reads an X11 or X10 window dump file as input and produces a PNM image as output.  The type of the output image depends on the input file - if it's black and white, the output is
       PBM.  If it's grayscale, the output is PGM.  Otherwise, it's PPM.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

#######################################
/bin/xxd
DESCRIPTION
       xxd  creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input.  It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form.  Like uuencode(1) and uudecode(1) it allows the transmission of
       binary data in a `mail-safe' ASCII representation, but has the advantage of decoding to standard output.  Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.

OPTIONS
       If no infile is given, standard input is read.  If infile is specified as a `-' character, then input is taken from standard input.  If no outfile is given (or a `-' character  is  in  its

/bin/xz
DESCRIPTION
       xz  is a general-purpose data compression tool with command line syntax similar to gzip(1) and bzip2(1).  The native file format is the .xz format, but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA
       Utils and raw compressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.

       xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected operation mode.  If no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard input and writes the processed data  to  stan-
       dard  output.   xz will refuse (display an error and skip the file) to write compressed data to standard output if it is a terminal.  Similarly, xz will refuse to read compressed data from

/bin/xzcmp
DESCRIPTION
       xzcmp  and xzdiff invoke cmp(1) or diff(1) on files compressed with xz(1), lzma(1), gzip(1), or bzip2(1).  All options specified are passed directly to cmp(1) or diff(1).  If only one file
       is specified, then the files compared are file1 (which must have a suffix of a supported compression format) and file1 from which the compression format suffix has been stripped.   If  two
       files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp(1) or diff(1).  The exit status from cmp(1) or diff(1) is preserved.

       The names lzcmp and lzdiff are provided for backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.
#######################################
/bin/xzdec
DESCRIPTION
       xzdec  is  a  liblzma-based decompression-only tool for .xz (and only .xz) files.  xzdec is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for xz(1) in the most common situations where a script
       has been written to use xz --decompress --stdout (and possibly a few other commonly used options) to decompress .xz files.  lzmadec is identical to xzdec except that lzmadec supports .lzma
       files instead of .xz files.

       To  reduce the size of the executable, xzdec doesn't support multithreading or localization, and doesn't read options from XZ_DEFAULTS and XZ_OPT environment variables.  xzdec doesn't sup-

/bin/xzdiff
DESCRIPTION
       xzcmp  and xzdiff invoke cmp(1) or diff(1) on files compressed with xz(1), lzma(1), gzip(1), or bzip2(1).  All options specified are passed directly to cmp(1) or diff(1).  If only one file
       is specified, then the files compared are file1 (which must have a suffix of a supported compression format) and file1 from which the compression format suffix has been stripped.   If  two
       files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp(1) or diff(1).  The exit status from cmp(1) or diff(1) is preserved.

#######################################
/bin/xzegrep
DESCRIPTION
       xzgrep invokes grep(1) on files which may be either uncompressed or compressed with xz(1), lzma(1), gzip(1), or bzip2(1).  All options specified are passed directly to grep(1).

       If no file is specified, then standard input is decompressed if necessary and fed to grep(1).  When reading from standard input, gzip(1) and bzip2(1) compressed files are not supported.

       If  xzgrep  is  invoked as xzegrep or xzfgrep then egrep(1) or fgrep(1) is used instead of grep(1).  The same applies to names lzgrep, lzegrep, and lzfgrep, which are provided for backward

#######################################
/bin/xzless
DESCRIPTION
       xzless is a filter that displays text from compressed files to a terminal.  It works on files compressed with xz(1) or lzma(1).  If no files are given, xzless reads from standard input.

       xzless uses less(1) to present its output.  Unlike xzmore, its choice of pager cannot be altered by setting an environment variable.  Commands are based on both more(1) and vi(1) and allow
       back and forth movement and searching.  See the less(1) manual for more information.

#######################################
/bin/xzmore
DESCRIPTION
       xzmore is a filter which allows examination of xz(1) or lzma(1) compressed text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.

       To use a pager other than the default more, set environment variable PAGER to the name of the desired program.  The name lzmore is provided for backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.

       e or q When the prompt --More--(Next file: file) is printed, this command causes xzmore to exit.

/bin/yuvsplittoppm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       yuvsplittoppm reads three files, containing the YUV components, as input.  These files are basename.Y, basename.U, and basename.V.  Produces a PPM image on Standard Output.

       Since the YUV files are raw files, the dimensions width and height must be specified on the command line.
#######################################
/bin/yuvtoppm
DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       yuvtoppm reads raw Abekas YUV bytes as input and produces a PPM image as output.  The input file is just YUV bytes.  You have to specify the width and height on the command line, since the
       program obviously can't get them from the file.  yuvotppm assumes the maxval of the input is 255.

#######################################
/bin/zcat
DESCRIPTION
       Gzip  reduces  the  size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes,
       access and modification times.  (The default extension is -gz for VMS, z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file name is "-", the  standard
       input is compressed to the standard output.  Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it will ignore symbolic links.

       If  the  compressed file name is too long for its file system, gzip truncates it.  Gzip attempts to truncate only the parts of the file name longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited

/bin/zcmp
DESCRIPTION
       Zcmp  and  zdiff  are used to invoke the cmp or the diff program on files compressed via gzip.  All options specified are passed directly to cmp or diff.  If only file1 is specified, it is
       compared to the uncompressed contents of file1.gz.  If two files are specified, their contents (uncompressed if necessary) are fed to cmp or diff.  The input files are not  modified.   The
       exit status from cmp or diff is preserved.

/bin/zforce
DESCRIPTION
       zforce  forces  a .gz extension on all gzip files so that gzip will not compress them twice.  This can be useful for files with names truncated after a file transfer.  On systems with a 14
       char limitation on file names, the original name is truncated to make room for the .gz suffix. For example, 12345678901234 is renamed to 12345678901.gz. A file name such as foo.tgz is left
       intact.

SEE ALSO
#######################################
/bin/zgrep
DESCRIPTION
       Zgrep  invokes  grep  on compressed or gzipped files.  All options specified are passed directly to grep.  If no file is specified, then the standard input is decompressed if necessary and
       fed to grep.  Otherwise the given files are uncompressed if necessary and fed to grep.

       If the GREP environment variable is set, zgrep uses it as the grep program to be invoked.

#######################################
/bin/zip
DESCRIPTION
       zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn RISC OS.  It is analogous to a  combination  of  the
       Unix commands tar(1) and compress(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).

       A companion program (unzip(1L)) unpacks zip archives.  The zip and unzip(1L) programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting most PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6), and
       PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by zip (with some exceptions, notably streamed archives, but recent changes in the zip file standard may facilitate better compatibility).
#######################################
/bin/zipcloak
DESCRIPTION
       zipcloak encrypts all unencrypted entries in the zipfile.  This is the default action.


       The -d option is used to decrypt encrypted entries in the zipfile.

/bin/zipgrep
DESCRIPTION
       zipgrep  will  search  files within a ZIP archive for lines matching the given string or pattern.  zipgrep is a shell script and requires egrep(1) and unzip(1L) to function.  Its output is
       identical to that of egrep(1).

ARGUMENTS

/bin/zipinfo
DESCRIPTION
       zipinfo lists technical information about files in a ZIP archive, most commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  Such information includes file access permissions, encryption status, type of com-
       pression, version and operating system or file system of compressing program, and the like.  The default behavior (with no options) is to list single-line entries for each file in the  ar-
       chive,  with header and trailer lines providing summary information for the entire archive.  The format is a cross between Unix ``ls -l'' and ``unzip -v'' output.  See DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       below.  Note that zipinfo is the same program as unzip (under Unix, a link to it); on some systems, however, zipinfo support may have been omitted when unzip was compiled.

ARGUMENTS
       file[.zip]
              Path of the ZIP archive(s).  If the file specification is a wildcard, each matching file is processed in an order determined by the operating system  (or  file  system).   Only  the

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       zipinfo  has  a number of modes, and its behavior can be rather difficult to fathom if one isn't familiar with Unix ls(1) (or even if one is).  The default behavior is to list files in the
       following format:

/bin/zipnote
DESCRIPTION
       zipnote writes the comments in a zipfile to stdout.  This is the default mode.  A second mode allows updating the comments in a zipfile as well as allows changing the names of the files in

/bin/zless
DESCRIPTION
       Zless  is  a  filter  which  allows examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the equivalent of setting the environment variable
       LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq -- %s', and the environment variable LESSMETACHARS to '<space><tab><newline>;*?"()<>[|&^`#\$%=~', and then running less.  However, enough people seem to think that
       having the command zless available is important to be worth providing it.

/bin/zmore
DESCRIPTION
       Zmore  is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  zmore works on files compressed with compress, pack or gzip,
       and also on uncompressed files.  If a file does not exist, zmore looks for a file of the same name with the addition of a .gz, .z or .Z suffix.

       Zmore normally pauses after each screenful, printing --More-- at the bottom of the screen.  If the user then types a carriage return, one more line is displayed.  If the user hits a space,
       another screenful is displayed.  Other possibilities are enumerated later.
#######################################
/bin/znew
DESCRIPTION
       Znew recompresses files from .Z (compress) format to .gz (gzip) format.  If you want to recompress a file already in gzip format, rename the file to force a .Z extension then apply znew.
